## Company Context

<div align="justify">
  
In this project, I collaborated with E-news Express, a digital news platform aiming to grow its subscriber base in an increasingly competitive online media landscape. As user behavior shifts toward fast, personalized content, the company recognizes the need to optimize user experience in order to boost engagement and conversion rates.

With a noticeable decline in new monthly subscribers, E-news Express suspected that its existing landing page was not capturing user attention effectively. To address this, the design team developed a new version of the page featuring an improved layout and more relevant content. In line with industry best practices, the company decided to conduct an A/B testing experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the redesigned landing page on user engagement and subscription conversions.

## Objective 

<div align="justify">
  
The goal of this project was to assess whether the newly designed landing page could outperform the existing version in terms of user engagement and conversion rates. As part of the Data Science team, I analyzed user interaction data from a randomized experiment involving 100 participants, evenly split between control and treatment groups. Through statistical analysis conducted at a 5% significance level, the objective was to generate actionable insights to inform E-news Expressâ€™s content and design strategies, ultimately aimed at maximizing subscriber acquisition.

These included answering the following business questions:
- Do users spend more time on the new landing page than on the existing one?
- Is the conversion rate for the new page significantly higher than for the old one?
- Does the conversion rate vary depending on the userâ€™s preferred language?
- Is the time spent on the page consistent across different language groups?
